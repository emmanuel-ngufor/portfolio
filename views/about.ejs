            My name is Emmanuel Ngufor and I'm currently a Freelance Software Developer who recently graduated from Seneca
            Polytechnic.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently immersed in the world of coding, I'm honing my skills by
            building Full Stack Projects. Beyond the realm of programming, I'm
            passionate about staying updated on the latest tech trends and
            exploring their impact on various industries. In my free time,
            you'll often find me delving into soccer, football, watching movies,
            and occasionally taking a break to enjoy outdoor activities. Excited
            about the endless possibilities that technology offers, I'm on a
            journey to merge creativity with coding proficiency.
          </p>
          Below is a list of programming languages, frameworks and data
          technologies in which I have a high proficiency.
